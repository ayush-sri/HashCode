# HashCode

The file with the algorithm is named as 'PizzaProb.py'.
The file firstly reads the name of the file, from where the test inputs are to be taken.

After porcessing the data,the proposed file processes the output in a '.in' extension file.
Th format of the file is as follows:

The first letter of the input file+ '_out.in'.
A note must be take that the algo requires the file name to be tested, else the algo will not work at all.
